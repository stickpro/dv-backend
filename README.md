Easy to launch - just follow steps below!

## Prepairing for installation

For successful installation you will need 3 domains:

- **Frontend domain.** Domain on which the personal account user interface will be deployed;
- **Backend domain.** Domain where the backend will be located;
- **Payment domain.** The domain where the payment form for your clients will be located;
- **Processing URL** contact [DV Support](https://t.me/dv_pay_support) to get it.

> For example, if your main site is on the `mybestshop.com` domain, then you can create the following additional domains:
>- `app.mybestshop.com` (frontend)
>- `api.mybestshop.com` (backend)
>- `pay.mybestshop.com` (payment)

Prepare a virtual machine with CentOS. All necessary update packages will be installed automatically during script execution.
